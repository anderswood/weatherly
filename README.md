# Weatherly
[Production Site](https://anderswood.github.io/weatherly/)

Weatherly is a weather forecasting app built with React.js that pulls weather data from the [Weather Underground API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/). The app enables users to view hourly and 10 day weather forecasts for a selected city and stores the most recently selected city in the browser's local storage. The app is fully responsive.

I built the app with one partner as part of a school project over one week.
